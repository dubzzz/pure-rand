## 8.0.0

### Migration from 7.x to 8.0

**No more main entry point** — Replace barrel imports with subpath imports:

```diff
-import { uniformIntDistribution, xoroshiro128plus } from 'pure-rand';
+import { uniformInt } from 'pure-rand/distribution/uniformInt';
+import { xoroshiro128plus } from 'pure-rand/generator/xoroshiro128plus';
```

**`rng` is now the first argument** — All functions now take the generator as the first parameter:

```diff
-uniformIntDistribution(1, 6, rng);
+uniformInt(rng, 1, 6);
```

**Functions mutate `rng` in-place by default** — The old "pure" functions (returning `[value, nextRng]` tuples) have been removed. Functions now directly return the generated value and mutate the generator. To get the old pure behavior, wrap with `purify`:

```diff
-const [value, nextRng] = uniformIntDistribution(1, 6, rng);
+import { purify } from 'pure-rand/utils/purify';
+const pureUniformInt = purify(uniformInt);
+const [value, nextRng] = pureUniformInt(rng, 1, 6);
```

**Renamed distributions** — Pure distribution names have been shortened:

| 7.x                                                                 | 8.0                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `unsafeUniformIntDistribution`                                      | `uniformInt`            |
| `unsafeUniformBigIntDistribution`                                   | `uniformBigInt`         |
| `uniformIntDistribution`                                            | `purify(uniformInt)`    |
| `uniformBigIntDistribution`                                         | `purify(uniformBigInt)` |
| `uniformArrayIntDistribution` / `unsafeUniformArrayIntDistribution` | _(removed)_             |

**`fromState` moved to dedicated exports** — Restoring a generator from its state now uses a separate function:

```diff
-import prand from 'pure-rand';
-const rng = prand.xoroshiro128plus.fromState(state);
+import { xoroshiro128plusFromState } from 'pure-rand/generator/xoroshiro128plus';
+const rng = xoroshiro128plusFromState(state);
```

**Dedicated `JumpableRandomGenerator` type** — Generators supporting `jump()` now implement a separate `JumpableRandomGenerator` interface (extends `RandomGenerator`). If you need generators with `jump()` method, update the type:

```diff
-import type { RandomGenerator } from 'pure-rand/types/RandomGenerator';
+import type { JumpableRandomGenerator } from 'pure-rand/types/JumpableRandomGenerator';
```
